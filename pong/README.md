This is an iteration of the famous pong game made in python, with the "pygame" library and following 101computing's tutorial (https://www.101computing.net/pong-tutorial-using-pygame-getting-started/)

I'm still working on the project, and aside from what I was taught following the guide, I want to add sound effects, a list with all the high scores and a menu for the game
